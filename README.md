# Symmetric_and_Asymmetric_Encryption_Two
## Generated an AES key using one class, and encrypt it with a public key. Using the same AES key, encrypt a random XML string and sign it with the public key.  
## In another class, decrypt the encrypted AES Key using the private key. Using this AES key, decrypt the encrypted XML string and check if it has been tampered with by using the private key.
